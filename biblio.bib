The project applies the principles of Linked Data and adopts the Open Annotation standard to record and publish commentary information. CHARMe contributes to the emerging landscape of ``climate services'', which will provide climate data and information to influence policy and decision-making. Although the project focuses on climate science, the technologies and concepts are very general and could be applied to other fields.},

The CORDEX Regional Challenges provide a focus for downscaling research and a basis for making use of CMIP6 global climate model (GCM) output to produce downscaled projected changes in regional climates and assess sources of uncertainties in the projections, all of which can potentially be distilled into climate change information for vulnerability, impacts and adaptation studies. CORDEX Flagship Pilot Studies advance regional downscaling by targeting one or more of the CORDEX Regional Challenges. A CORDEX-CORE framework is planned that will produce a baseline set of homogeneous high-resolution, downscaled projections for regions worldwide. In CMIP6, CORDEX coordinates with ScenarioMIP and is structured to allow cross comparisons with HighResMIP and interaction with the CMIP6 VIACS Advisory Board.},

The Sentinels are ensuring long-term observational commitment and will operate a range of instruments with different spectral bands and spatial resolutions with global coverage and high revisit times. The complexity of Earth System models has been increasing gradually and most simulations of future climate and Earth system evolution are based on coupled models that include aspects of physics, bio/geo-chemistry, anthropogenic impacts and even recently some elements of socioeconomic factors. Sentinels will provide unique observations to describe such coupled atmosphere, oceans, land and cryosphere and the exchanges among them into Earth System models. This paper emphasizes the indispensable value of the data provided by the family of Sentinel constellations in the context of the urgent need for improved process understanding of the Earth system.},

  abstract = {Observations of Earth from space have been made for over 40 years and have contributed to advances in many aspects of climate science. However, attempts to exploit this wealth of data are often hampered by a lack of homogeneity and continuity and by insufficient understanding of the products and their uncertainties. There is, therefore, a need to reassess and reprocess satellite datasets to maximize their usefulness for climate science. The European Space Agency has responded to this need by establishing the Climate Change Initiative (CCI). The CCI will create new climate data records for (currently) 13 essential climate variables (ECVs) and make these open and easily accessible to all. Each ECV project works closely with users to produce time series from the available satellite observations relevant to users' needs. A climate modeling users' group provides a climate system perspective and a forum to bring the data and modeling communities together. This paper presents the CCI program. It outlines its benefit and presents approaches and challenges for each ECV project, covering clouds, aerosols, ozone, greenhouse gases, sea surface temperature, ocean color, sea level, sea ice, land cover, fire, glaciers, soil moisture, and ice sheets. It also discusses how the CCI approach may contribute to defining and shaping future developments in Earth observation for climate science.},

  title = {Designing and {{Documenting Experiments}} in {{CMIP6}}},
  issn = {1991-962X},
  abstract = {{$<$}p{$><$}strong{$>$}Abstract.{$<$}/strong{$>$} Earth system modelling relies on contributions from groups who develop models and from those involved in devising, executing, and exploiting numerical experiments. Often these people work in different institutions, and they may communicate primarily via published information (whether journal papers, technical notes, or websites). The complexity of the models, experiments, and methodologies, along with the diversity (and sometimes inexact nature) of information sources can easily lead to misinterpretation of what was actually intended or done. In this paper we introduce a taxonomy of terms for more clearly defining numerical experiments, put it in the context of previous work on experimental ontologies, and describe how we have used it to document the CMIP6 experiments. We describe how this process involved iteration with a range of CMIP6 stakeholders to rationalise multiple sources of information and add clarity to experimental definitions. We demonstrate how this process has added value to CMIP6 itself by a) helping those devising experiments to be clear about their goals and expected methodology, b) making it easier for those executing experiments to know what was intended, c) exposing inter-relationships between experiments, and d) making it clearer for third parties (data users) to understand the CMIP6 experiments. We conclude with some lessons learned, and how these may be applied for any modelling campaign as well as future CMIP phases.{$<$}/p{$>$}},

  abstract = {{$<$}p{$><$}strong{$>$}Abstract.{$<$}/strong{$>$} The data request of the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 6 (CMIP6) defines all the quantities from CMIP6 simulations that should be archived. This includes both quantities of general interest needed from most of the CMIP6-endorsed Model Intercomparison Projects (MIPs) and quantities that are more specialised and only of interest to a single endorsed MIP. The complexity of the data request has increased from the early days of model intercomparisons, as has the data volume. In contrast with CMIP5, CMIP6 requires distinct sets of highly tailored variables to be saved from each of the more than 200 experiments. This places new demands on the data request information base and results in a new requirement for development of software that facilitates automated interrogation of the request and retrieval of its technical specifications. The building blocks and structure of the CMIP6 Data Request (DREQ) which has been constructed to meet these challenges is described in this paper.{$<$}/p{$>$}},

Previous efforts, (a) through the W3C SSN project, and (b) following ISO rules for conversion from UML, had dependencies on elaborate pre-existing ontologies and frameworks. The new ontologies, known as om-lite and sam- lite, remove such dependencies, and can therefore be used with minimal ontological commitment beyond the O\&M conceptual model. Time and space concepts, for which there are multiple existing solutions, are implemented as stub-classes, and patterns for linking to the existing ontologies are described. PROV is used to support certain requirements for the description of specimens. A more general alignment of both observation and sampling feature ontologies with PROV is described, as well as mappings to some other observation models and ontologies.},
